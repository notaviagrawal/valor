# Valor
> A decentralized data network for real-time, local price information.

Valor is a Worldcoin Mini App that empowers a global community to create a transparent, real-time price ledger for everyday goods. By turning any shopper into a trusted data provider, we are building a more efficient and equitable market for everyone, from individual consumers to national governments.

## The Problem
Local economies, especially in developing nations, often run on guesswork and unequal information. This creates asymmetric markets where:

* Consumers can't be sure if they are paying a fair price.
* Small vendors struggle to price their goods competitively without losing money.
* Governments and NGOs lack the high-frequency, granular data needed to track inflation accurately and respond to economic events effectively.

## The Solution
Valor solves this by creating a decentralized data network with a simple, powerful loop:

1.  **Contribute**: Anyone with a smartphone can anonymously submit the price of an item by taking a picture.
2.  **Verify**: Using Worldcoin's Proof of Personhood, we guarantee that every submission comes from a unique human, eliminating bots and data manipulation.
3.  **Earn**: Users are rewarded with our native token, `$VAL`, for every valid data point they contribute, creating a global micro-earning platform.
4.  **Empower**: The aggregated, real-time data is made available, creating a transparent public utility that benefits everyone.

## Key Features
üåç **Global Price Ledger**: Crowdsource a real-time database of prices for any item, anywhere.  
üí∞ **Micro-Earning Platform**: Earn `$VAL` tokens by contributing data during your daily shopping.  
üîí **Sybil-Resistant**: Built on Worldcoin's Proof of Personhood to ensure every data point is from a unique, verified human.  
üìä **Alternative Data Market**: Creates a unique, high-value dataset for public sector actors, financial institutions, and NGOs.  
üìà **Real-Time Inflation Tracking**: Provides an unprecedented ground-level view of economic trends, enabling faster and more effective policy responses.

## Technology Stack
* **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
* **Authentication**: Worldcoin IDKit & NextAuth.js for session management.
* **UI**: Mini Apps UI Kit for compliance with the World App design system.
* **Token**: `$VAL` (ERC-20 token on a low-cost L2 like Optimism).
* **Backend**: Smart contracts for data validation and token distribution.

## Getting Started
This project is a World App Mini App. To run a local instance for development, follow these steps.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/valor.git](https://github.com/your-repo/valor.git)
cd valor
````

#### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3\. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example file and fill in your details from the Worldcoin Developer Portal.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Your `.env.local` should contain your App ID and Action ID.

#### 4\. Generate Auth Secret

NextAuth requires a secret key. This command will generate one for you.

```bash
npx auth secret
```

#### 5\. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 6\. Expose Localhost with Ngrok

In a new terminal window, expose your local server to the internet.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok.

#### 7\. Update Configs

  * In `.env.local`, set `AUTH_URL` to your ngrok URL.
  * In `next.config.ts`, add your ngrok domain to `allowedDevOrigins`.
  * In the Worldcoin Developer Portal, update your Mini App's URL to the ngrok URL.

## The Data Economy

The alternative data market is projected to grow to over $140 billion by 2030. Valor is positioned to capture a unique segment of this market by providing datasets that are currently impossible to acquire.

Our primary customers are public sector actors:

  * **Central Banks & Governments**: To track inflation with real-time accuracy.
  * **Humanitarian NGOs**: To monitor food prices and predict shortages.
  * **Economic Researchers**: To study market dynamics with granular, high-frequency data.

By making markets more efficient, Valor's data can help smooth out harsh economic cycles and lead to more stable and prosperous communities.
